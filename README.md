In this project, I’m working on building and testing different machine learning models to predict a simple yes-or-no outcome based on several features in a dataset. 
I’m exploring a variety of methods, from classic models like Logistic Regression and KNN to more advanced techniques like SVMs and Random Forests. 
I’m also diving into newer approaches like Gradient Boosting and Neural Networks. The idea is to see which model performs best by comparing their accuracy and ability to correctly identify positive and negative cases.
Ultimately, the goal is to find the most effective model for making reliable predictions with this data.
